      These are the official posting guidelines ("Site Guidelines") for
      <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/"><span>www.ratemyprofessors.com</span></a> website,
      application or other interactive service ("Site”). The Site is owned, operated and/or provided

      Rate My Professors is the largest online destination for students to research and rate
      professors, colleges, and universities across the United States. Our mission is to provide a
      safe forum to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education
      choices.

  <p>
    <strong>THE SITE/APP</strong>
  
    </p><p>
      <span>
        The Rate My Professors website (<a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/"><span>www.ratemyprofessors.com</span></a>) and mobile app provide user generated feedback on professors' teaching methods and their
        respective courses as well as user generated feedback on the lifestyle and facilities of
        college and university campuses.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        Professor ratings should only be posted by users who have taken a class from the professor or
        who are currently taking a class with the professor. For each course a professor teaches,
        users are limited to posting one (1) comment. Campus ratings should only be posted by students
        who have attended or are currently attending the specific course, college or university being
        rated.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        Rate My Professors is NOT the place to report dangerous, illegal or illicit behaviors. If you
        believe that you, another professor, or a student is in danger, we strongly advise you to
        report such incidences directly to your campus authorities or local law enforcement. (For more information and resources, please read <a href="https://help.ratemyprofessors.com/article/71-bias-and-discrimination-in-the-classroom" target="blank">here)</a>.

    <strong>HOW WE WORK</strong>
    </p><p>
      <span>
        Rate My Professors has a team of moderators who read every rating submitted. We have defined
        site guidelines to help reinforce our mission and most importantly to ensure our decisions
        around moderation are 100% consistent, regardless of student or professor. Our moderators are
        experts on our guidelines and will remove any comment that doesn’t comply.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        Did we miss something? If you feel an inappropriate comment should be removed from the site,
        we want to know. You can flag a comment for re-review and it will immediately be escalated to
        our moderators. Moderators will determine whether to remove the rating permanently or restore
        it to the website. Our moderators will never edit a rating to make it comply or remove a
        rating simply because it is a low score or negative review.

    <strong>GUIDELINES:</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Student Guidelines:</strong>
    </p><ul>
      <li>
        Be honest in your reviews. You want to be able to trust these reviews when evaluating your
        course options so we ask that to contribute in the same spirit.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are reviewing a class and/or professor, it’s often helpful to provide both pros and
        cons. This leads to much more credible and constructive feedback for your peers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reviews should focus specifically on the course and your learning experience. Do not comment
        on a Professor’s appearance, dress, age, gender or race.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid hearsay. We want you to share your individual experience and what you took away from the
        course. Don’t speak on behalf of another, encourage others to submit their own reviews.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is not a forum for debate. Reviews that specifically reference another review will be
        removed. If you do not agree with someone’s individual experience, we encourage you to share
        your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        We understand that not all teachers are the perfect match for each individual learning style.
        Tell us how the course or professor wasn’t the best for you in a way that helps others make
        their own decision.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reviews fueled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations
        such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your review will genuinely help
        others understand your experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate My Professors reserves the right to remove ratings that do not contain substantive
        comments.
      </li>
      <li>
        We only allow one student to review a professor one time per course. Spamming or dogpiling an
        account will lead to comment removal and the account being temporarily locked on the site.
      </li>
      <li>
        When reading your fellow students reviews, we encourage you to use your discretion and weigh
        every review amongst the others. Online reviews should be one of the many resources used when
        making a decision that affects your academic future.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Prohibited Content:</strong>&nbsp;<span>Comments that contain the following will be removed:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Profanity, name-calling, and/or vulgarity, derogatory remarks about religion, ethnicity or
        race, gender, physical appearance, age, mental and/or physical disabilities;</li>
      <li>Identifiable information about a professor or student that would allow someone to contact the
        professor/student outside of their school;</li>
      <li>References to a professor's or student’s family, personal life and/or sex life, including
        sexual innuendos;</li>
      <li>Claims that a professor shows bias for or against a student or specific group of students (For more information and resources, please read <a href="https://help.ratemyprofessors.com/article/71-bias-and-discrimination-in-the-classroom" target="blank">here)</a>;</li>
      <li>Claims about a professor's employment status, including previous employment;</li>
      <li>Claims that a professor or student engages or has engaged in illegal activities;</li>
      <li>Direct references to other existing comments or comments that have been deleted by our
        moderators;</li>
      <li>Accusations that the professor is rating him/herself or his/her colleagues;</li>
      <li>A language other than English. Comments must be written in English only. French is allowed if
        you attend a French-Canadian school;</li>
      <li>Hyperlinks and / or URLs.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>Professor Guidelines:</strong>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is an anonymous website where students can share their classroom experiences. We are
        unable to provide any data or personal information about the submitter of a review.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not proactively add any professor, course or campus to our website, every profile was
        submitted by our student community.
      </li>
      <li>
        We are unable to remove a comment simply because it is negative. It will only be removed if it
        doesn’t comply with our site guidelines.
      </li>
      <li>We encourage you to engage with students on the site by creating a Rate My Professors account. With a Professor account, you have the ability to post a reply and get alerted when new ratings are posted on your profile. To create your professor account, get started <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/joinprof.jsp"><span>here</span></a>.</li>
      <li>Replies fueled by anger do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violations such as profanity. Take a minute to step back and make sure your reply will genuinely help others.</li>
      <li>
        Rate My Professors' moderation team is unable to prove or disprove details mentioned in a
        review. We are not arbiters of facts. If you disagree with the details mentioned in a review,
        see paragraph above regarding managing your profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you believe that your profile is being spammed or dogpiled, please tell us. You can contact
        us at
        <a href="mailto:support@ratemyprofessors.com"><span>support@ratemyprofessors.com.</span></a>
        We’re here to help and will happily review the comments in question.
      </li>
      <li>
        While it is against our guidelines for a professor to rate themselves, we recommend for
        professors to encourage their students to provide ratings each semester. The more reviews you
        have, the more representative they will be.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professor replies are subject to the same limitations regarding Prohibited Content, as set forth
        above.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>FLAGGING A RATING</strong>
    </p><p>
      <span>
        If you see a rating that you believe violates these Site Guidelines, please click the "report
        this rating" at the bottom of the comment and state the problem. Such comments will be
        evaluated by the Site's personnel. Please do not flag a rating just because you disagree with
        it.

  <p>
    <strong> SOME LEGAL STUFF </strong>
    </p><p>
      <span>
        Rate My Professors occasionally receives removal demands that include threats to sue Rate My
        Professors. To date, no one has followed through with a lawsuit against us for our reviews.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        The law protects Rate My Professors from legal responsibility for the content submitted by our
        users, like the reviews that appear on our site. Specifically, the Communications Decency Act
        of 1996 (47 U.S.C. Sec. 230) created a federal immunity to any cause of action that would make
        service providers, like Rate My Professors, liable for information originating with a
        third-party user of the service.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        The law is clear on this. Anyone who wishes to sue Rate My Professors for the reviews posted
        by our members risks penalties imposed by the court. These may include financial sanctions and
        reimbursement of our attorney's fees for our having to defend against a lawsuit that ignores
        obvious legal protections for Rate My Professors.
      </span>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span>
        If, despite our caution, you feel that legal action is the only recourse for you, our address
        for service of legal process is:
